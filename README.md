# Small, fullstack web aplication
Aplication was projected and built in less than 15 hours for the hackaton BestHacks Wroc≈Çaw 2021.

We wanted to make a web app, to help people make an appointment with a doctor faster and to let them see the doctor sooner. They just need to ansewr a few questions and thanks to that they will be made an appointment to see the right doctor, or if they need referral to a specialist, their appointment will be made for shorter visit (for example 5 minutes) just to fill the papers and get the referal.
After logging in, users will also be able to see which periodic medical examinations are suggested for them to make.

App isn't finished, but it's a working prototype.
